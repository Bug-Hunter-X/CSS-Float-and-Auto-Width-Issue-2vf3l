The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue is that if the parent element's width is not specified, the div will not be 50% of the available space as one might expect. Instead, it will take up 50% of its parent's *auto* width.
